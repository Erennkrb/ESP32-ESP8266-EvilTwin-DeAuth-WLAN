## FEATURES :
* [+] Deauth
* [+] Evil-Twin
* [+] User Interface

## TESTED ON :
* Nodemcu
* Probably will work in all-other boards too...

## INSTALLATION :
* Install [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
* Add Esp8266 in Additional Board Manager `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json`
* Esp8266 board  [NODEMCU](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B010O1G1ES/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_glt_i_MAFEQVVXSRR69JXNYFA3)
* Install your board, choose correct Port.
* Compile and Upload.
* For detailed explanation check on [blogger](https://zansecurity.blogspot.com/2022/02/hacking-wifi-using-esp8266-deauth-and.html)

## CONCEPT :
* Connect to the Access Point named `ZiFi` with password `Eviltwin` from your device.
* Select the target you want (list of available APs refreshes every 15secs - page reload is required).
* Select The Attack Mode. If you choose Deauth it will start deauthing the clients in that network.
* Then Start Evil-twin attack, which will create the clone of the selected network.
* The web interface will be unavailable during Evil-twin attack mode, You need to reconnect.
